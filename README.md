## wpf-daterange-slider
#Project Description
#A WPF Date Range Slider user control written with C# to allow your users to choose a range of dates using a double thumbed slider control.

#Some features I needed in this control are:
#* Ability to choose a range (high and low) of DateTime values with a single slider.
#* Donâ€™t let the the lower slider or upper slider pass each other. I was creating this to use with a graph and if the sliders passed each other even for a millisecond, the graph would throw an exception.
#* Enable or disable the upper or lower sliders separately 
#* Ability to lock the lower slider or upper slider at the minimum or maximum values respectively.
